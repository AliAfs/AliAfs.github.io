Hello, I'm Ali, an engineer specializing in data science and engineering. Currently, I work as a Data Analyst at a startup company in Bremen, Germany, having completed my Master's Degree in Data Engineering. Throughout my master's studies, I developed an interest in the application of deep learning in vision problems. Master thesis focused on adaptation and training a Self-Supervised Vision Transformer for 3D medical imaging data. 

Prior to this, I earned a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and worked as an undergraduate research assistant at the Mechanics and Renewable Energies Lab at Ferdowsi University. During this period, I contributed to research on solar-powered water desalination systems.

On a more personal note, I'm amazed by the transformative power of meditation, and curious about philosophy, and the nature of the mind. Recently, I've taken up running and cycling, finding joy in the pursuit of reconnecting mind and body!
