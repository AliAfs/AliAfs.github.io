  abstract={In recent years solar-powered desalination systems have received much attention as a clean and sustainable solution to freshwater demand. One challenge in the field is to maximize the systemâ€™s efficiency. This study focuses on the volumetric direct solar steam generation and provides a model-based optimization using support vector regression and decision tree regression ensemble molding. The model achieves train R2=0.99, validation R2=0.91, and test R2=0.92. For optimization, Nelder-Mead and differential evolution methods are used. Results predict that suspending 0.015 weight-percent of GNP-MWCNT to water achieves the maximum efficiency under 1 kW/m radiation.},

  abstract={Using renewable energy, especially solar energy, is an essential requisite for preventing global warming and climate change. Solar-powered steam generation is one of the recent solutions to the problem of environmental pollution and can be a promising way to generate clean energy. In this study, the superficial and volumetric approaches of the zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO) in solar vapor generation have been compared experimentally. For the volumetric approach, the nanofluid performance at different mass concentrations (0.001\%, 0.002\%, and 0.004\%) on the solar vapor generation was examined. For the superficial approach, the evaporative performance of delignified mulberry wood coated by ZnO nanoparticles as an absorbent (ZnO-Wood) was investigated. Moreover, the effect of nanoparticle size on optical and evaporative properties was evaluated. Finally, the economic performance of the ZnO nanofluid was compared to the other nanofluids. The results indicated that the evaporative efficiency of the nanofluids containing ZnO(50 nm) nanoparticles at 3 suns (3 kW/m2) was approximately two times greater than that of water (18\%). However, the evaporative efficiency of ZnO-Wood was 3.15 (56\%) times greater than that of water. In addition, the results of the nanoparticle size effect showed that increasing the size of nanoparticles from 20 nm to 50 nm in the superficial and volumetric approaches increases the evaporative efficiency by roughly 10\% and 3\%, respectively. Finally, the cost analysis of nanofluid for solar vapor generation illustrated that ZnO nanoparticles are cost-effective compared to other nanoparticles presented in the literature.},

  title={Solar steam generation via localization solar energy on the water surface},
  author={Ghafurian, MM. and Afsharian, A. and Rahimpour Esfahani, F. and Niazmand, H.},
  abstract={In the present study, the performance of steam generation via localization of solar energy on the water surface investigated. For this purpose, solar radiation, Fresnel lenses, glass vessel with Temperature sensors and digital balance are used to study the evaporation performances of samples in different thickness and carbonization process experimentally. The results showed that the employed floating membranes on water surface which are hydrophilic not only improve evaporation performances but also decrease the heat dissipation to the fluid bulk. The evaporation rates of pure water, water accompanied by wood and carbonized wood are 4.26 kg/m2h, 13 kg/m2h and 15.13 kg/m2h respectively.},
